# Designing the To-do-List Application

- Reference: Bro Code
- The component in which code is written is TodoList.jsx
- We have used to state variable:

  - `task state` : it is an array on which we map the function. the initial state of task variable is `empty array`
  - `newTask state`: it represent the input tag where user can write the new task he/she want to include. the initial state of newTask variable is `string`

- Creating the function `handleChange` -> which maps the input tag with the newTask state variable
